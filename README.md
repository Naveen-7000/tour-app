Tourism planning is the process of considering the needs of people planning a
trip and using those factors to determine the best resources, programs and activities
for their trip. Tourism planning is intended for local residents and businesses of
the location, as well as tourists who travel there. It is a process of setting objectives,
identifying a course of action, analysing and implementation of a plan that will
favour tourism and its policies. It embraces different dimensions like social,
economic and environmental. It is the first and foremost step of any destination
to be an attraction for the tourists.
